## Overview
This document provides a summary of various machine learning models and their common real-world use cases.

## Models and Use Cases

| **Model Type** | **Real-World Scenario Use** |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
| **Linear Regression** | Predicts continuous outcomes, such as house prices or stock values. |
| **Logistic Regression** | Handles binary classification tasks like email spam detection or credit risk assessment. |
| **Decision Trees** | Utilized in decision-making tools in finance for option pricing, and customer segmentation in marketing. |
| **Random Forests** | Applied in fraud detection in finance, medical diagnosis in healthcare, and feature selection. |
| **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** | Used for image classification, text categorization, and bioinformatics (e.g., cancer classification). |
| **Naive Bayes** | Employed in text classification/natural language processing for sentiment analysis and spam filtering. |
| **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** | Implemented in recommender systems, image recognition, and retail marketing to identify patterns in customer data. |
| **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)** | Handles tabular data in various domains, including credit scoring and customer churn prediction. |
| **XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost** | Offers high performance for structured/tabular data across finance, healthcare, and marketing. |
| **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** | Used in image and video recognition, image classification, medical image analysis, and self-driving car systems. |
| **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** | Suitable for language modeling, text generation, speech recognition, and time-series forecasting. |
| **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** | Addresses sequence prediction problems like time-series prediction, music generation, and text translation. |
| **Transformer Models** | Applied in natural language processing tasks like language translation, text summarization, and question-answering systems. |
| **Autoencoders** | Used for anomaly detection in network security, image denoising, and dimensionality reduction for visualization. |
| **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)** | Generates realistic photographs, creates artwork, enhances low-resolution images, and produces realistic human-like voices. |
| **Stacked Generalization** | Combines multiple models to improve overall performance in tasks like credit risk assessment and customer churn prediction. |
| **Bagging** | Reduces overfitting by combining multiple models in tasks like image classification and text categorization. |
| **Boosting** | Improves model performance by iteratively combining multiple models in tasks like credit scoring and customer segmentation. |
| **Clustering Algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN)** | Used for customer segmentation, anomaly detection, image segmentation, and document clustering. |
| **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** | Employed for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and data visualization. |
| **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)** | Visualizes high-dimensional data for better understanding and clustering. |
| **Hierarchical Clustering** | Groups similar data points into clusters based on their features. |
| **K-Medoids** | Clusters data points based on their features and distances. |
| **Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm** | Handles missing data in tasks like image segmentation and text classification. |
