### **Introduction**

- The process involves creating a Docker image, pushing it to the Azure Container Registry, and deploying it to an Azure Web App.

### **Steps for Azure Deployment**

- Convert the application into a Docker image.
- Push the Docker image to the Azure Container Registry.
- Create an Azure Web App.
- Configure the Web App to pull the Docker image from the Container Registry.

### **Azure Container Registry**

- Similar to AWS ECR, the Azure Container Registry is used to store private Docker images.
- The Docker image created in the previous step will be pushed to the Container Registry.

### **Azure Web App**

- The Azure Web App will act as the server for the deployed application.
- The Web App will pull the Docker image from the Container Registry and install it.

### **Docker Image Creation**

- Use the Docker build command to create the image and follow the naming convention.
- Build the image from the specific repository.
- Install the requirements for the image.

### **Pushing the Docker Image**

- Login to the Container Registry using the Docker login command.
- Push the Docker image to the Container Registry.

### **Azure Web App Deployment**

- Create a new Azure Web App resource.
- Select the Container option and configure it to use the Docker image from the Container Registry.

### **GitHub Actions Integration**

- Enable continuous deployment in the Azure Web App.
- Set up GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy the Docker image to Azure.

### **Conclusion**

- The deployment process involves creating a Docker image, pushing it to the Azure Container Registry, and deploying it to an Azure Web App.
